⏺ Here are inspiring tool-use capabilities that would be reliably evaluatable and interesting to train:

  🎯 Highly Practical

  Data Table Operations
  - Parse/manipulate CSV-like data, compute aggregations, filter rows
  - Evaluation: Compare output tables exactly
  - Why cool: Real data analysis workflows, teaches structured data understanding

  Regex Pattern Generator
  - User: "Match emails" → generates regex pattern
  - Evaluation: Test pattern against known valid/invalid cases
  - Why cool: Teaches symbolic pattern abstraction

  Unit Converter with Awareness
  - Not just "10 miles to km", but "I'm 6 feet tall, how tall in meters?"
  - Evaluation: Verify numerical conversion
  - Why cool: Combines NLU + precise calculation

  🎨 Creative & Visual

  ASCII Art/Diagram Generator
  - Generate boxes, tables, simple flowcharts, bar charts
  - Evaluation: Check structure/dimensions programmatically
  - Why cool: Visual output, teaches spatial reasoning
  <|python_start|>
  for i in range(5): print('█' * (i+1))
  <|python_end|>
  <|output_start|>
  █
  ██
  ███
  ████
  █████
  <|output_end|>

  Markdown Table Formatter
  - Convert data to properly formatted markdown tables
  - Evaluation: Parse and verify structure
  - Why cool: Practical for docs/reports

  🧮 Symbolic/Abstract

  Boolean Expression Simplifier
  - "(A AND B) OR (A AND NOT B)" → "A"
  - Evaluation: Truth table equivalence check
  - Why cool: Teaches logical reasoning

  Set Operations Visualizer
  - "Union of {1,2,3} and {2,3,4}" with visual representation
  - Evaluation: Verify result set
  - Why cool: Mathematical reasoning + visualization

  Symbolic Differentiation
  - Differentiate simple polynomials symbolically
  - Evaluation: Verify against sympy
  - Why cool: Shows algebraic manipulation capability

  🎮 Interactive/Stateful

  Game State Manager (Tic-Tac-Toe)
  - Execute moves, check win conditions, display board
  - Evaluation: Verify game rules followed
  - Why cool: Multi-turn reasoning, rule following

  Chess Notation Parser/Validator
  - Parse algebraic notation, validate legal moves
  - Evaluation: Check against chess engine
  - Why cool: Complex domain with strict rules

  🔬 Advanced

  Code Execution Trace
  - Execute simple programs step-by-step, show variable states
  - Evaluation: Verify trace correctness
  - Why cool: Meta-programming, debugging capability

  Graph Algorithm Executor
  - Given graph structure, run BFS/DFS/shortest path
  - Evaluation: Verify algorithm output
  - Why cool: Algorithmic reasoning

  Constraint Solver
  - Simple constraint satisfaction (sudoku cells, scheduling)
  - Evaluation: Verify constraints satisfied
  - Why cool: Logical reasoning under constraints

  🌟 Most Inspiring IMO

  1. ASCII visualization - Combines creativity with precision
